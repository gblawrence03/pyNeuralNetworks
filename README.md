# pyNeuralNetworks

In this project I aim to learn to create and use simple neural networks in Python.

So far I have created a simple perceptron classification visualiser which will classify arbitrary data using a single layer perceptron and visualise it using a graph. 
To run the visualiser simply start main.py in the perceptronVisualiser folder.

In the future I will create networks of arbitrary size and with hidden layers with the ability to train on data via back propogation.
